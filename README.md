## Hi there 👋

 I work with real case-study data, energy modelling tools, and performance analysis for hybrid systems such as **RO-HDH**, **HDH–freezing desalination**, **CSP–MED**, and **PV–desalination integration**.  
 I use GitHub to document my projects, share simulation work, and build a portfolio aligned with my academic and research goals.
- ## Technical Skills
  - **Programming:** Python, MATLAB
  - **Energy Modelling:** Desalination systems, CSP–MED, HDH, hybrid RO systems
   - **Simulation & Analysis:**
Thermodynamic modelling, data analysis, performance validation
  - **Tools:** Jupyter, MATLAB Simulink, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
  -  ## Featured Projects Here are the projects I’m currently developing and refining:
  - **Hybrid HDH–Freezing Desalination Model**     Performance modelling, energy balance, cost and water-production estimation.
- **RO–HDH–PV Hybrid System**     Integrated reverse osmosis + humidification–dehumidification + photovoltaic powering.
  - **CSP–MED with Thermal Storage**     Solar thermal integration, MED performance modelling, storage analysis.
 - **Wind Energy Potential Assessment**     Python-based wind resource analysis and Weibull distribution fitting.
